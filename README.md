Project overview:
This project features a Power BI dashboard designed to provide an in-depth analysis of revenue and profit data. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations, key performance indicators, and customizable filters, enabling users to explore financial trends and gain actionable insights. It serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to monitor business performance and make data-driven decisions.

Data sources:
SALES DATA: The data for this Power BI dashboard is sourced from four CSV files containing sales data for four years, from 2016 to 2019.

Tools:
Power BI: Used for creating and designing the interactive dashboard.
Power Query: Utilized for cleaning and transforming the data to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis.
SQL: Employed for data analysis to extract, manipulate, and analyze data efficiently.
Data cleaning/preparation:
Combining Files: The data from the four CSV files was combined using Power Query to create a unified dataset for analysis.
Handling Missing Values and Outliers: Missing values and outliers were addressed through appropriate techniques to maintain data integrity.
Standardizing Data Formats: Data formats were standardized to ensure consistency across the dataset.
Creating Calculated Columns and Measures: Calculated columns and measures were created to facilitate analytical insights and visualization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
What are the overall trends in revenue and profit over the four-year period from 2016 to 2019? Are there any noticeable patterns or fluctuations?
How does revenue and profit vary across different regions? Which regions contribute the most to overall sales, and are there any regions with notable growth or decline trends?
